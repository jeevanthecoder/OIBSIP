Hello Oasis InfoByte,
I've successfully completed the Projects that were assigned during the internship. 
I've provided the revised/summarized video in this repository.
As the complete explanation video is of size 200MB it exceeded the size limit of the github.

So I'm providing the drive link for the complete video : https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LzftDfho2YnjcxWA7WPMyUH5mXdumGin/view?pli=1
