Hello Oasis InfoByte,
I've successfully completed the Projects that were assigned during the internship. 
I've provided the revised/summarized video in this repository.
As the complete explanation video is of size 200MB it exceeded the size limit of the github.

So I'm providing the drive link for the complete video : https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LzftDfho2YnjcxWA7WPMyUH5mXdumGin/view?pli=1 

My LinkedIn Post link : https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jeevan-h-b779ba229_javadevelopment-internshipupdate-oasisinfobyte-activity-7156664700942848001-rKA8?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop

I've also provided the QR Code for the Main Video.

**And I've explained both of my projects in the single video itself.**

Thank you,
Jeevan H
